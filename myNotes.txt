1. Made the js file to be able to run the server
  a) serve the files you will be using
     -link for help: http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html
  b) import any libraries you will be using through the git terminal
    ex: express --> "npm install express", i'm using express because it's
    supposed to be a framework based on Node.js for building web Application
    using principles and approaches of Node.js.
  c) try it out "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js"

2. Probably should have done this first, but make a package.json file (can get
   the default done with "npm init -y" or make your own with "npm init" and this
   will ask you individually for each section).

      -my nav bar comes from this link and I changed it so that there's only
      two sections, the left and the right. Basically, I took out the first
      section which instead of getting rid of the right section it moved the
      middle over to the right.

4. Added the background picture of the entire webpage.
    -linked a css page to it and set the picture through that.
